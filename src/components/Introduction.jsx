            I have a committed passion for computer programming and have made
            the change to pursue my dream in becoming a software developer.<br /><br />
            In times when I'm not programming, I'm working out or spending time with loved ones. 
            I'm also a huge fan of MMA and PC gaming.<br /><br />
            I find enjoyment in both front-end and back-end sides of the software development spectrum.
            If you're interested in finding out more about me or have any questions,
            please do not hesitate to contact me through the from below at anytime.</p>
